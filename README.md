>IT'S TRUE! Taking long hiatuses between coding sessions makes it more likely you're going to be forgetting something. Basic syntax, formatting, or the proper way to use your favorite libraries/modules. This being true in my case, for that reason I have started this project

The objective of this project is quite simple; gather Python project ideas, and work on a few every day. To flex my OOP and sharpen that skill is the challenge I set for myself.
